GMAP Zikula MODULE
-------------------------

- Upload to you Zikula modules folder
- Go to your Modules administration
- Initialize, activate the GMap module.
- Go to GMap administration

There are four administration areas:

MAP SETTINGS
  "Map Display"
  - Fill in your Google API Key (see http://www.google.com/apis/maps/)
    NOTE: this must be done for a map to be displayed
  - Add your values for your default Google Map (Latitude, Longitude, Map Type, Zoom Level, and size)
  - If you would like to load map information from a file, give a filename to load.
    For an example, you can load "modules/gmap/pndocs/Example.xml"
    Also see this file for an example on how you can create other map files.  These files can update the
    map title, location, zoom level and the pin labels.  Values in the file will over ride default values set in
    the gmap administration.

  "Side Bar Display"
  - Set the width of the side bar.  Note: the width of the map and the width of the side bar must be able
    to fit side by side on the page for this to look right.
  - If you want User Markers in the side bar, then enable and set the maximum height of the list
  - If you want Special Markers in the side bar, then enable and set the maximum height of the list
  - If more items are on the list than can be displayed in the maximum height, scroll bars will be used.

  "Marker Legend Display"
  The marker legend allows you to show labels for the colored markers on the map.  
  For example, the "marker_purple.png" marker can have a label of "Home Location".
  These values are set under "Marker Settings" below.
  When shown, the Legend will show an image of the marker, the marker label, and a check box to toggle the 
  visibility of the markers on the map and side bar.
  - To show the User Marker legend at the bottom of the map, enable it and give the number or columns for the table.
  - To show the User Marker legend at the bottom of the map, enable it and give the number or columns for the table.  
  - To show an Address search form at the bottom of the map, enable it.  This will allow your people to type in
    and address and have the map re-centered on the new location.
    
MARKER SETTINGS
- In the GMap administration, go to "Marker Settings"
  This area has two sections.  One for Special Markers and one for User Markers.
  In each section, enable those markers which you want to be made available and visible on your map.
  Also give the Name for the marker which will be used in the Marker Legend (above) as well as any drop down
  marker selections in forms.  Only those markers that are enabled will be shown.
  Note: Reading a map from a file can overide these settings.
  
SCAN FOR NEW MARKER IMAGE FILES
 This section is used if you add any new icons or want to reset to the initial configuration.
 Submitting will scan the directories shown for new icons and add any that are not already used (keeping data
 for those that already exist.)
 The "Force reload" will overwrite existing data with the data from the directories.  All marker names will be 
 reset to the default values.

EDIT MARKERS
 This section allows you to edit markers that have been saved in the database.
